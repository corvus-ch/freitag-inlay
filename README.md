# Freitag inlay

[![CC BY-SA 4.0][cc-by-sa-shield]][cc-by-sa]

Templates to build custom inlays for the [Freitag F26 Agenda][f26].

## How to use?

You will need:

* A [Freitag F26 Agenda][f26]
* An printer for A4 sized paper
* A way to cut paper on straight lines
* An [Atoma puncher][puncher]
* A PDF template from this repository

1. The templates are designed to be printed double side.
   Use long edge binding in your printer settings.

   If your printer does not support double-sided printing, you can do it manually.
   First, print all odd pages.
   Then flip the paper and put them back in to your printer.
   You need to experiment with how you have to do the flip.
   Finally, print the even pages.

2. Now cut the printouts along the cut lines.
   Think before you start cutting.
   If done in the wrong order, you cut away cut lines you need for a later cut.

3. Stack the sheets in the right order and orientation and punch them with the Atoma puncher.

4. Assemble the punched sheets into your Freitag F26 Agenda.

## Available Templates

* Dotted: 5mm dotted
* Gridded: a rectangular gridded pattern similar to the one of the [Freitag F27 Refill][f27]
* SOTA log: An amateur radio log book for Summits on the Air.
